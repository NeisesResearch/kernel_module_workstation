What is this?

> This is a workbench to support the creation of kernel modules for use with camkes-vm-linux.

 How do I use it?

> At this time, [prepareWorkstation.sh](https://github.com/NeisesResearch/vm_measure/blob/main/prepareWorkstation.sh) automates the whole procedure.
> After it succeeds, you have only to start your Docker instance with this repo as the /Host directory.
> Then enter the camkes-arm-vm/build directory and run the [buildModuleMinimal.sh](https://github.com/NeisesResearch/vm_measure/blob/main/buildScripts/buildModuleMinimal.sh) script.

Where can I read the top-level procedure?
